#I used brute-force approach when I did my extra credit homework 
#I know that was stupid  
#try to make it a math problem this time
#Using recursion
//current queen: (x,y)
//next queen: (i,j)
//so if they are in diagonal: |i-x|=|j-y|
//if they are in the same row: i == x
//if they are in the same column: y == j

def check
//check if the chesses are not on the same column/diagonal/row


def mainMethod
//base case
if row == 9,
  print the chess board
  return 
//recursion
  while column < 9
  if check returns true //call the check method
  put a queen
  if the mainMethod returns  false
    go backto put the queen on the next location...
  else:
    return true  // maybe need to be delete if want all solutions
return false
